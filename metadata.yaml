description: This novel about a young man's intellectual and spiritual development
  was the first work John Henry Newman wrote after entering the Roman Catholic Church
  in 1845. The story describes the perplexing questions and doubts Charles Reding
  experiences while attending Oxford. Though intending to avoid the religious controversies
  that are being heatedly debated at the university, Reding ends up leaving the Church
  of England and becoming a Catholic. A former Anglican clergyman who was later named
  a Catholic cardinal, Newman wrote this autobiographical novel to illustrate his
  own reasons for embracing Catholicism.
